What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had a peculiarly challenging time testing the code, and most of my time was spent debugging the testing rather than writing new code. I would greatly recommend talking to classmates who are also working on the assignment, as several of my errors were more minor mistakes that just needed a second eye. Also, I found referencing the in-class OneCard example to be super helpful!!!
